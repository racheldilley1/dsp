[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

The code below generates a series of 1000 random numbers ranging between 0 amd 1:

    random = np.random.random(1000)
    
The numbers generated by numpy.random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. To prove this we try plotting the PMF(code found below). The ouput graph is a solid rectangle with pmfs ranging from 0 to 0.001 and numbers from 0 to 1 as expected. This shows the limitations of pmfs, as our sample size is too large to get a readable graph as output. Becuase of the range of our sample (0 to 1) binning would not be a solution and would be tricky to accomplish, graphing the CDF would be a better option. 

    pmf_rand = thinkstats2.Pmf(random)
    thinkplot.Pmf(pmf_rand)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random number', ylabel='PMF')
    
Graphing the CDF (code shown below) we find that the slope is constantly increasing from 0 to 1 and each random number approximately ,matches up with the respective percentage, indicating a uniform distribution. 

    cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(random)
    thinkplot.Cdf(cdf)
    thinkplot.Config(xlabel='random number', ylabel='CDF')
